# Kreato's Website

My *new* website, using Sveltekit, Tailwind and Flowbite.

## Developing

Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/kreatoo/website-new`

Once you've entered the project directory and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
